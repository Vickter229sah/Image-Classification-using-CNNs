# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using CNNs

This project demonstrates how to create an image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

## Project Overview

This project involves the following steps:
1. **Setting Up the Environment**: Install necessary libraries and tools.
2. **Importing Libraries and Loading Data**: Load and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset.
3. **Building the CNN Model**: Define the architecture of the CNN model.
4. **Compiling the Model**: Configure the training process with an optimizer, loss function, and metrics.
5. **Training the Model**: Train the model using the training dataset and validate it using the test dataset.
6. **Evaluating the Model**: Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset and visualize the training process.
7. **Making Predictions**: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data and visualize the results.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/cifar10-image-classification.git
cd cifar10-image-classification
pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Load and preprocess the dataset**:
    - Normalize pixel values to be between 0 and 1.
    - Display sample images from the training set.

2. **Define the CNN model architecture**:
    - Build a sequential model with convolutional and pooling layers.
    - Add dense layers for classification.

3. **Compile the model**:
    - Use the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss function.
    - Set accuracy as the evaluation metric.

4. **Train the model**:
    - Train the model for 10 epochs using the training dataset.
    - Validate the model using the test dataset.

5. **Evaluate the model**:
    - Evaluate the model's performance on the test dataset.
    - Plot the training and validation accuracy over epochs.

6. **Make predictions**:
    - Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.
    - Visualize the predictions and compare them with true labels.
